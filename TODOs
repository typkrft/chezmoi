  - [ ] Chezmoi should look for that script and if it exists run it form a run_ script
- [ ] Add Git Credentials, keys, etc
- [ ] Document Dots 
- [ ] Look for additional .chezmoi.toml functionality
- [ ] Make .chezmoiignore more percise with template shell commands

# Doing 

# Done
- [X] Look at order of zshrc in hyrule and see what needs to be sourced where to make history search work NOTE: This was not an order issue, but ubuntu needed a .zshenv setting
- [X] Consider setting facts like gui in chezmoi.toml instead of zshrc with functions 
- [C] Create a script that downloads private repos on init
- [X] Sort out nvim config, using NVChad requires various dependiences that differ on each platform, and LunarVim install is currently borked for macOS homebrew neovim installs.
