# Inbox
- [ ] Correctly space my templates eg {{- if eq "" "" -}}
- [ ] Add Ansible play book that is called with a run script that pulls all my private stuff and places it where needed
  - [ ] Chezmoi should look for that script and if it exists run it form a run_ script
- [ ] Add Git Credentials, keys, etc
- [ ] Document Dots 
- [ ] Consider setting facts like gui in chezmoi.toml instead of zshrc with functions 
- [ ] Look for additional .chezmoi.toml functionality
- [ ] Make .chezmoiignore more percise with template shell commands
